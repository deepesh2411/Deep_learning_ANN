# Deep_learning_ANN Artificial Neural Network
I have created an Artificial Neural Network model on the random bank dataset to find that which employee is going to left the bank and vice-versa.

#part 1: Data Preprocessing
  a) Importing the required libraries
  a) Preprocess the data set i.e  kept the required column in a dataframe
  b) Label encoding and onehotencoding for categorical data
  c) split the data set into train and test
  d) feature scaling as model should be fit on same scale
  
#part 2: Building ANN model
  a) Importing the required keras libraries
  b) creating object of sequential class
  c) Adding Input layer
  d) Adding hidden layer 1
  e) Adding hidden layer 2
  f) Adding output layer
  g) Comiple the model and fit it with training set data
  h) Making Prediction on test set
  g) calculating accuracy using Confusion Matrix
  
#part 3: Making the prediction on new data

#part 4: Save the model for future prediction
  used the json file to save the model and its weights
  
#part 5: Loading the model to predict
  
  
# code_file 
    part 1 to part 4 :  My_ann.py 
    part 5           :  loading_model.py
